# llm_summary_readability
Use permutation and bootstrap tests to determine the impact of prompt changes on the readability of LLM summaries

### Setting up

- Install the requirements in a new environment 
- See the notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to see how to use the scripts in this package
- `dataset_assembly.PatientSummaryGenerator` could easily be adapted for other LLM use cases 
- The empirical statistical tests described in the Medium article can be found in `statistical_tests`
